Bad Account Database Synchroniser
=================================

This tool synchronises the GoonSwarm account database from LDAP to various bad
tools that keep their own account databases.

LDAP is an industry standard for centralising logins, group and access management
which has led to countless applications creating their own half-baked integration
with LDAP. One example of terrible software that doesn't do it properly is all
forum software currently in existence.
